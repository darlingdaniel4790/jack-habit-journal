  "You are invited to take part in a research study being conducted by Oladapo Oyebode, a graduate student in Faculty of Computer Science at Dalhousie University. The purpose of this research is to design and develop an adaptive system, called JackHabbit, to improve resilience. Resilience is the ability to successfully adjust to a challenging situation or effectively cope with or recover from stress or adversities. JackHabbit, which will be accessible via the web or mobile devices, aims to provide evidence-based interventions to promote resilience among adults (18 years or older). The study is funded by Mitacs Canada.\n\nIn this study, you will be asked to journal daily for 2 weeks. Your daily log will generally contain your thoughts and experience including your joys, achievements, hopes, fears, and expectations. Feel free to express yourself, as there is no limit to the number of words in your journal. Each day, you are expected to logon to a journaling application using your email address and a password (which you will create if you are a first time user), fill-in the journal, and complete a questionnaire to express how you feel before and after journaling. At least 10 minutes of your time will be required daily.\n\nTo be eligible to participate in this study, you should be 18 years or older, be proficient in English, and have good internet connectivity. Your email address will be collected as part of this study; hence your data are identifiable but protected and confidential and will only be accessible to the researchers including the co-investigator and supervisor. All survey responses will be stored securely on Dalhousie server and password-protected computers. Also, sensitive data (such as email address, password, etc.) collected via the journaling application will be encrypted. In addition, data transfer is fully encrypted (using Secured Socket Layer Certificate) to prevent unauthorized access while collecting and storing data. As mentioned earlier, we will not disclose any information about your participation in this research study. However, if we suspect abuse or neglect of a child (or an adult in need of protection), we are required by law to contact authorities. \n\nParticipation is voluntary, and you can withdraw at any time without penalty. However, you can only withdraw your data only if the data are yet to be analyzed and results published. Specifically, withdrawal will not be possible after 6 months of participating in the study. If you intend to withdraw, you can terminate your session by closing your browser or you can contact the lead researcher through his email if you want your data erased before the deadline specified above. In general, partial and complete data will be retained for analysis unless the lead researcher is instructed otherwise by the research supervisor. \n\nFindings from this research may be published journal articles and/or conference proceedings. Only aggregated results will be published, and quoted texts will be completely anonymous. Data will be retained indefinitely; however, personally identifiable data (such as email address) will be permanently deidentified or anonymized after one year. \n\nThere are little or no risks/discomforts associated with this study since adequate measures have been put in place to ensure data protection and your safety. You may elicit fatigue and/or negative emotions while journaling, but the likelihood of these occurring is relatively low. \n\nFinally, apart from compensation, there may be no direct benefits for you for taking part in this study. Indirect benefits include contribution to knowledge in the area of adaptive/personalized systems or interventions for boosting people’s resilience which in turn promotes improved physical, psychological, and emotional wellbeing. As regards compensation, you will automatically be entered for a draw to win a $25 gift card (4 winners will be selected). In addition, you will be given full access to JackHabbit for 1 month at no cost after deployment. \n\nWe are happy to talk with you about any questions or concerns you may have about your participation. Please contact Oladapo Oyebode (at oladapo.oyebode@dal.ca) or Dr. Rita Orji (at rita.orji@dal.ca) at any time with questions, comments, or concerns about the research study. If you have any ethical concerns about your participation in this research, you may also contact Research Ethics, Dalhousie University at (902) 494-3423, or email: ethics@dal.ca. \n\nBy clicking the “I Agree” button below, you agree to participate in this study and you understand that your journal entries and/or comments may be quoted for research purpose without revealing your identity.";
